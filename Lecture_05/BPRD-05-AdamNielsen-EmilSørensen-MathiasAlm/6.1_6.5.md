# 6.1
## 1
7

## 2
7

## 3
We expected 7 and got 7.

## 4
We only give one paramater, so we get returned a function that can take one more parameter.

# 6.5
## 1
### 1
val it: string = "int"

### 2
It was unable to figure out a type due to circularity from g having g as its only parameter.

### 3
val it: string = "bool"

### 4
The if statement tries to return either an int or a bool, so it breaks.

### 5
val it: string = "bool"

## 2
### bool -> bool
inferType(fromString"
let f x = x = true in f end
");;

val it: string = "(bool -> bool)"

### int -> int
inferType(fromString"
let f x = x + 0 in f end
");;

val it: string = "(int -> int)"

### int -> int -> int
inferType(fromString"
let f x = let g y = x + y in g end in f end
");;

val it: string = "(int -> (int -> int))"

### 'a -> 'b -> 'a
inferType(fromString"
let f x = let g y = x in g end in f end
");;

val it: string = "('h -> ('g -> 'h))"

### 'a -> 'b -> 'b
inferType(fromString"
let f x = let g y = y in g end in f end
");;

val it: string = "('g -> ('h -> 'h))"

### ('a -> 'b) -> ('b -> 'c) -> ('a -> 'c)
inferType(fromString"
let f = 
	let g h1 =
		let k h2 =
			let m x = h2 (h1 x)
			in m end
		in k end
	in g end
in f end
");;

val it: string = "(('o -> 'n) -> ('n -> 'p) -> ('o -> 'p))"

### 'a -> 'b
inferType(fromString"
let f x = f x in f end
");;

val it: string "('e -> 'f)"

### 'a
inferType(fromString"
let f x = x in f end
");;

val it: string "('d -> 'd)"

We found that it was impossible to find something with return type 'a. The closest we got was 'a -> 'a.
